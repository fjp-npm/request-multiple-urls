_request-multiple-urls_ is a JavaScript package to fetch JSON data from a collection of url endpoints.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @fjp-npm/request-multiple-urls
```

## Usage

```javascript
const requestMultipleUrls = require('@fjp-npm/request-multiple-urls'); 

const urls = [
    'https://google.com',
    'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/10',
    'https://ft-tech-test-example.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/ftse-fsi.json'
];

requestMultipleUrls(urls).then(urlContent => { 
  console.log(urlContent);
});
```
The `requestMultipleUrls` function returns an array of objects where each object represents the JSON returned 
from one endpoint. If an endpoint does not return valid JSON then nothing is added to the response array for that 
particular url and a debug message is written to the console.

Type information is included for TypeScript support.
